## Gradient Descent Algorithm
### Code by Ravi Raj Chakravadhanula and Rajendra Sreevatsa Kalakodimi

The aim of the project is to code for the Gradient Descent Algorithm without the usage of inbuilt packages.

### Requirements and running the code:
The required packages to run the code on the local are:
1.kaleido==0.2.1
1.pandas==1.2.4
1.numpy==1.20.1
1.plotly==5.3.1
1.scikit-learn==0.24.1

They can be installed using the _pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt_.
Once the packages are installed, the code simply can be run on terminal using _python path/to/file/part1.py_.
